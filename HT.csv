The two constituencies in the state’s eastern and western parts are also a world apart in terms of topography, dialects etc. But the problems tribals face across Madhya Pradesh remain the same.', '“The tribals face the same problems, be it the Gonds in Mandla and Shahdol or the Bhils in Jhabua-Alirajpur. Most tribals, who account for 21% of the state’s population, remain poorly educated and desperately poor. They depend on agriculture and have to migrate to sustain themselves. Most do not have access to proper health facilities,” said Aneesh Thillenkery of the Ekta Parishad, an organisation that says it has been fighting for the tribal rights. There appears to be little resonance of the real tribal issues in the election campaign for the ongoing national polls. The BJP’s campaign in Khargone, Dhar and Ratlam, the remaining three tribal seats that would go to the polls on Sunday, has focused on nationalism and the Centre’s welfare measures and ruling Congress alleged failure in implementing its loan waiver promise.', 'The Congress has been banking on the welfare measures the party claims to have delivered for the tribals over the years apart from its loan waiver scheme for the farmers. It has also made the electoral pledge of ensuring a minimum guaranteed annual income of Rs 72,000 for the country’s poorest 20% a key election issue.', 'Kantilal Bhuria, who is the Congress’s candidate for the Ratlam seat, insisted his party has done everything for the tribals.

But we are also stressing on nationalism and security.”', 'He added the BJP government’s record in implementing the forest rights law is the best in the country. “Of the 6.17 lakh requests for title deeds, nearly 2.49 have been given… 1.10 lakh are being reviewed. No one has been evicted,” Kulaste said. He acknowledged the health facilities across the tribal belt remained poor and that the BJP has failed to gain the total confidence of the tribals. “That is why we were voted out,” he said, referring to the BJP’s poor performance in the tribal belt in the 2018 assembly polls.', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 18, 2019 09:13 IST\n']"

It was 66.54 % in 2018 and this year it was 61.32 %. That the slide took place despite best of five rule, under which students need to clear only five exam out of six, has rattled the Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE) and school education department.', '“From July 2018,  80% teachers were appointed as booth level officer (BLO) for revision of the voters’ list. Later in November, they got busy in conducting election. After election again in January, they were appointed as BLO for voters’ list revision for Lok Sabha. Teachers couldn’t pay any attention on students due to poll duties and that is reflecting in the result,” an officer of school education department.    ', 'In the last two days, the authorities are in a huddle to find ways to improve the percentage. According to MPBSE secretary Ajay Gangwar, “The pattern of the exam will be more like CBSE with more objective type questions. Work is going on in developing sample question papers. We will distribute it among the schools to make students aware about the pattern.”', 'Another board official said that they would publicise the ‘Ruk Jana Nahin’ scheme which aims at ensuring the students who have failed do not lose a year. Under the scheme, the students sit for exams (in the subjects they have failed) under the Madhya Pradesh state open school board and the marks of the MP board and open school board are added.', 'Another thrust area was improving the standard of teaching by organizing regular teacher’s training through refresher course and also to ensure that teachers are not engaged in election duty unnecessarily.', '“Most teachers are not motivated and their method of teaching is outdated, they need effective refresher courses. We have spent over Rs 40 cr in refresher courses last year, but the results are not there,” the official said.', 'But Gangwar said the main problem was election duty thrust upon the teachers. “MP has already facing crises of teachers and most of the teachers were engaged in the election duties. They couldn’t concentrate on enhancing the performance of weak students.”', 'MP Teachers Association general secretary Ashutosh Pandey said, “Teachers should be freed from other activities.

"At BHU, gender intersects ideological battle",2019-05-18, 08:45,https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/at-bhu-gender-intersects-ideological-battle/story-BbQ9bp8UBgNUTeJglUJM7O.html,"['Sakshi Singh was right there when Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the main gate of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on 25 April to kick off his 7-km road show and election campaign for the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat. She stood just a few metres to his left as he went up a flower-studded staircase to garland the bust of Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya, the founder of BHU. Wearing a white T-shirt which said “NaMo again” and a saffron-and-green wristband, Singh joined her voice with thousands of people circling the statue enclosure: Modi, Modi, Modi… Forty other young women wearing the same T-shirt and standing behind her chanted the same word. Singh  hadn’t quite expected so many of them to come out and face the crowds and the heat.', '“I had requested the organisation for 100 shirts to distribute in MMV, but when I collected them and posted a status update about it, I received 200 requests. I got some more T-shirts and gave out at least 175 on my own in this so-called Leftist centre,” she said. The organisation she refers to is Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and MMV stands for Mahila Maha Vidyalaya, a women’s college in the BHU with its own hostel inside the campus. The MMV is known, inside and outside the campus, as an island of opposition to the complete hold of the Sangh over BHU (which explains Singh’s Leftist remark). When people in BHU say Sangh they usually mean the Hindu right-wing establishment RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad), BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) and ABVP…', 'In BHU, people do bring up Sangh a lot, except in MMV. ', 'On 21 April, just four days before Modi’s arrival, nearly 50 female students of the BHU marched through Varanasi asking for an end to oppression and patriarchy. The walk was organised by the Joint Action Committee, an alliance of progressive students committed to social justice, equality and democratic space, which is seen as a leftist group by those affiliated or attracted to the sangh. “Girl students are a little more rational,” said Amrita Singh, a PhD student. “In some hostels, the Left and the Samajwadi ideologies continue to survive,” she said. Left can also mean supporters of the Congress party in BHU speak. ', '“They only organised the walk with one agenda, to dampen  the mood in Banaras before Modi’s filing of his nomination for the seat,” said Singh.', 'Hindu nationalism is central to BHU’s political life, and BHU has had a lot to contribute to the political life of Hindu nationalism. It was set up in 1916 by Malviya, a scholar of Hinduism and a proponent of nation-building, and counts among its early influencers MS Golwalkar, the second Sarsanghchalak of the RSS. At the time of admission, students receive a booklet containing information they would find useful in negotiating life at BHU. It begins with a message from Pandit Malviya stressing “learning”, “patriotism”, and “self-sacrifice” as building blocks of a man’s worthiness.', '“If Jawaharlal Nehru University is a symbol of un- Indianness, the Banaras Hindu University is a symbol of Indianness. If you look at the BHU’s constitution, it talks about Indianness,” RSS leader Manmohan Vaidya reminded everyone in 2018.', '“Madan Mohan Malviya built this campus on the foundation of Hindu nationalism,” said Abhay Pratap, co-convenor of the ABVP’s campus unit. “Once a student enters this campus bachhe ke andar desh ke liye bhavna aa jaati hai (he or she starts thinking about the nation). They start going to RSS’ shakhas in the university. Then they are attracted to the student organisation that is following its ideology, which is ABVP.” ', 'That’s what happened to Pratap in 2015 when he came to BHU from Gorakhpur to study political science. “The ABVP’s nation-first ideology attracted me.” The ABVP, he said, is also the only student group with enough campus currency -- 80 office bearers and thousands of supporters-- to get “work done.” “We question the administration, and the government, on student issues, from admission fee to unfair suspension. At times we have protested against Modi government also, about the CBSE paper leak or the CLAT entrance,” he said. CBSE stands for Cental Board of Secondary Education;  CLAT is short for Common Law Admission Test, in which some glitches arose.', 'Mostly, though, the ABVP in BHU promotes and benefits from the national rise of the BJP and Narendra Modi. “After 2014, the (number of)  RSS shakhas in the campus multiplied. Thanks to Modi ji, ABVP’s orbit also expanded. More and more boys were attending these shakhas, more and more were joining the ABVP,” Pratap said. Currently, he said, “we fully dominate the campus.”', 'This domination makes the campus a very conservative space, say students who refer to themselves as politically neutral. “When new boys come from the interiors... they see girls, they see short clothes, and they can’t handle it. And when these girls educate themselves, start thinking, start speaking up, the boys can’t digest it. This frustration enters their politics. That contributes to ABVP’s domination here,” says Sisendra Sisodia. “The multiple layers of RSS, ABVP and BJP gives them clout at ideological, political and students’ affairs level. So what do you think the campus politics will be: conservative or progressive?” he asked.', 'Pratap doesn’t see it that way. He insists ABVP is changing with a changing campus. “BHU is in a transition period, from hostel timings to education curriculum,” said Sisodia. “Earlier there was only arts, science and IIT. Now there is women’s studies, skill development, professional courses. Students ki demand hai. Time ki demand hai (Students are demanding this. The times are demanding this.) ', 'At such a time, he said, “there should be no space for discriminatory policies in a campus, whatever the situation outside.”', '“Five- six years ago people who were with ABVP believed that non-veg should be stopped in all hostels. We supported the women’s demand for equality in mess. Today we are campaigning for a 24-hour canteen. On this Women’s Day ABVP organised a seminar on ‘women’s role in shaping 21st century’,” Pratap said. ', '“The women in BHU are not interested in jumla-bazi (slogans),” said Amrita Singh who has played an active role in the women’s protests. For most part, ABVP’s image of being male-dominated and conservative has alienated the women. In recent years, BHU has repeatedly made national headlines for its female students’ agitations for “azaadi” -- to extend their curfew hour, to be allowed “non-veg” in their canteen, to wear “western” clothes, to be allowed same flexibility in mess fees as the male students. “Every day the girls fight a little towards towards further freedom,” said Amrita Singh. The ABVP hasn’t exactly been an ally. “The concept of azaadi is facinating for the women, but Banaras ka mahaul aisa nahin hai ki ladkiyan late night bahar nikal sakein (Banaras doesn’t have the kind of atmosphere in which women can go out late at night)” said Pratap. “Their curfew has been extended to 10 pm after protests but now they are demanding that there be no regulation on their comings and goings, like in the boys’ hostels. But the Sangh only supports what is possible and what is practical,” he added.', 'And, as Sakshi Singh exemplifies, the ABVP’s reach has extended to the women in BHU too. ', 'In 2018, after a violent face-off between female students and ABVP’s men,  Singh “became totally active in the ABVP. I began to organise events, from self-defence workshops to science debates, for women. My motto was to pull women free from the clutches of leftist-feminists. I said to them we don’t have to independent, we can be inter-dependent. Leftist-feminists continue to be more in number but now at least 13-14 girls in MMV are with ABVP and many more support us, BJP and Modi,” she added.', 'Aparna Singh is not so sure. “The girls are listening to everyone’s speeches, they are watching everyone’s videos -- Modi’s, Kanhaiya Kumar’s, Mahagathbandhan’s. The mood in women’s hostels is increasingly anti-BJP,” she said. “We are studying political science, sociology, Satre, Marx. The haze lifts. There is new democratic awareness. Surprising numbers of women students have taken leave to go home and vote this time. We also know how difficult it is for women to clear a space for themselves in a masculine society in which the discourse is about 56-inch chests and Pilibhit’s tigers,” she said. ', 'Earlier in 2019, Sakshi Singh was made a National Executive Committee member of the ABVP. For months she has worked hard to improve BJP’s electoral chances, from organising voter awareness camps to nukkad nataks (street plays). She has been up there and out there with the men but at times she feels “frustrated”. On 25 April, she and her team of ABVP’s women members walked two km to Assi Ghat “side by side” with Modi’s caravan, but they couldn’t go any further. There were just too many men. “There was so much pushing and shoving.We could go that far only because our own men were surrounding us. But I was in no condition to carry on. I was feeling harassed.”', ' In spite of the “challenges” she faces “as a woman, especially in such situations” Sakshi Singh is going to stick with the ABVP. And when she casts her first vote in Varanasi on 19 May, it will be for Narendra Modi. ', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 18, 2019 08:45 IST\n']"

The truth about eggs...,2019-05-18, 00:13,https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/the-truth-about-eggs/story-UBbUqSFHcqSvznWugnLS8O.html,"['Why is Taron Egerton’s character in the 2014 release Kingsman (also starring Colin Firth) nicknamed Eggsy? Sadly, the film doesn’t ever explain. But wouldn’t it be the perfect nickname for many around us, simply because of their love for eggs?', 'Take Delhi resident Prithvi, for example. Last month the 38-year-old returned to the treadmill after a gap of 10 years. What prompted him was not his weight – which was touching 100 kg – or any real concern over the fact that he was beginning to pant every time he negotiated the flight of stairs to his second-floor apartment in south Delhi. Nor was it with any idea to lose the growing paunch that his wife had been cribbing about for years. “I had a routine medical check-up and my blood cholesterol level was high. Considering my weight issues, the doctor put all kinds of dietary restrictions on me, including cutting down my meat and eggs intake,” says Prithvi. “I don’t eat meat daily. But not having eggs was like a punishment. So I thought maybe if I lost some weight and became healthier, I could continue to have eggs,” he adds with a laugh.', 'Medical journals define cholesterol as a waxy substance in the blood, needed to build cells, among other things. It is of two kinds – high-density lipid (HDL) and low-density lipid (LDL). The problem arises when there is too much cholesterol in the blood (especially of the sticky LDL kind called bad cholesterol), which can then accumulate on the artery walls, choking them and increasing risks of heart attacks and other cardiac problems.', 'In his 1906 novel Love Among The Chickens, PG Wodehouse asks, “Have you ever seen a man, woman, or child who wasn’t eating an egg or just going to eat an egg or just coming away from eating an egg? I tell you, the good old egg is the foundation of daily life.” For years, however, this ‘nature’s multivitamin’ as it is often referred to, for its rich store of nutrients, has been maligned because of its association with that dirty, scary ‘C’ word – cholesterol. A big egg (weighing about 50 gm) has about 184 mg of cholesterol, which is concentrated in the yolk. ', '“The simplistic reasoning was that cholesterol is not good for health, it gets deposited in the arteries, egg yolk contains a high level of cholesterol, so avoid eggs,” explains Dr Vikram Jaggi, director, Asthma, Chest & Allergy Centre, Delhi.', 'Scientists in America began researching the links between lifestyle, diet and cardiovascular diseases in humans from the late 1940s. In 1968, the American Heart Association (AHA) announced a dietary recommendation that all individuals should consume less than 300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day and not more than three whole eggs in a week. This American apprehension then spread to the rest of the world, depriving many an egg-lover of their favoured source of nourishment.  ', 'In a 2015 article, The 50 Year Rehabilitation of the Egg, available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website, Donald J McNamara (former director of the Egg Nutrition Center) recalls the effect the  AHA guideline had on consumption. “The egg industry was faced with a difficult situation... fight back and be accused of putting profits ahead of public health or simply give in to the dietary cholesterol phobia...” he writes. The decline in egg consumption finally “prompted the egg industry to establish the Egg Nutrition Center to promote research and initiate health education ...”.', 'According to a 2017 article on the National Public Radio website, Walter Willett of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health was one of the first physicians to realise that while cholesterol is associated with higher risks of heart disease, there was no proof that cholesterol consumption increased its levels in the blood. “Willett and his colleagues have since studied thousands of patients for years and have found no evidence that moderate dietary cholesterol or egg consumption increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, except in people with a strong genetic risk for high cholesterol and possibly people with diabetes.” Other researchers have also over the years have also failed to find a link between dietary cholesterol and its level in the blood and given a clean chit to eggs.', 'A 2017 article in Harvard Health  Publishing pointed out that only about 20 per cent of the cholesterol in our blood comes from the food we eat. Agrees nutritionist and author, Kavita Devgan, “A large percentage of the cholesterol in our body is manufactured in the body. It has little relation to what we eat.”', '', 'To Eat Or Not To Eat', 'But the confusion – and contradictory opinion – about eggs persists. In the past one year two studies came up with very different findings. In March this year, various publications reported the findings of a study published in the The Journal of the American Medical Association, which found “that for each additional 300 milligrams a day of cholesterol in the diet, there was a 17 per cent increased risk of cardiovascular disease and an 18 per cent increased risk of premature death from any cause.” The study had been conducted among almost 30,000 participants, over a period of 17 years. Eggs – because of their rich cholesterol content – “had the same more-is-worse effect”, wrote the New York Times (NYT) while reporting on the study. Norrina B Allen, lead author of the study and associate professor of epidemiology at Northwestern University, however, was quoted by the NYT as saying, “eggs have some advantages – amino acids and minerals... You do want to reduce the number of eggs, especially egg yolks, as part of a healthy diet. But we don’t want people to walk away thinking they shouldn’t eat any eggs.” Earlier, in May last year, CNN had reported on research by Canqing Yu, associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing and his colleagues, which found that “daily egg-eaters had an 18 per cent lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease”. ', 'Meanwhile, Jaggi’s patients continue to ask him about whether they should have eggs and how many is too many. ', 'In the US, The Dietary Guidelines  2015-2020, removed the earlier limit on dietary cholesterol, but cautioned that “individuals should eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible” because “foods that are higher in dietary cholesterol... are also higher in saturated fats.” This means eggs should be safe because they contain little saturated fat. The British Heart Foundation has also removed their earlier restrictions, which recommended people with high cholesterol levels to not consume more than three-four eggs a week. “One reason for this [confusion] is that we doctors are taught more about diseases and medicines than about good health and diets,” says Jaggi. “As a result, we do not have good scientific knowledge of what kind of food is good and what isn’t. Much of what we know about diets are hypothesis.” ', 'The National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) India, launched the campaign ‘Sunday ho ya Monday, roz khao ande’ in the 1980s. The campaign became an instant hit and enjoys recall even today. “That campaign was launched in response to prevalent religious beliefs which made people avoid eggs – as part of non-vegetarian – food on certain days of the week,” recalls national vice-chairman, NECC, Sandeep Mehta. But that does not mean that poultry farmers weren’t affected by the medical flip-flop over eggs. “About 20 years back the cholesterol worry was making many give up eggs. Our business had been seriously affected. We had even visited doctors to try and understand the concern and see if anything could be done to address it,” recalls Mehta.', 'Today most doctors in India are of the opinion that it’s all right to eat eggs – at least in moderation. “Healthy adults, till the age of 40, may have one to two eggs a day. Those with a more active lifestyle – sportsmen for example – may even three-four eggs a day. After 40, as activity levels go down, one egg a day is good,” says Ritika Samaddar, chief clinical nutritionist at Max, Delhi. And by egg, she means a whole egg – not just the white. “Egg whites only are the biggest myth. It is true that most of the calories, as well as all the cholesterol, in an egg is in the yolk. But it is also rich in nutrients such as protein and vitamins. I always advise a whole egg for all my patients,” she says. Samaddar believes even vegetarians will benefit from eggs, even if they don’t eat meat. “Being an animal protein, it has 100 per cent absorption. Vegetable protein has fibres and other nutrient inhibitors present making it unavailable for absorption,” she says. ', '', 'Those with a high cholesterol issue or with a history of heart ailments or diabetes, may also have eggs – but should probably restrict it two about two-three a week, says cardiologist Praveen Chandra, who practices at the Medanta hospital. “Dietary cholesterol raises the total serum cholesterol in the body, but is a less important contributor to coronary heart diseases than saturated fat. Eggs are a chief source of dietary cholesterol, but the association between regular egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke are uncertain,” says cardiologist KK Aggarwal, president, Heart Care Foundation of India. “In patients with high cholesterol, it is more important to restrict trans fat and bad saturated fats.” So avoid making an omelette in hydrogenated oil, he cautions.', 'Check your breakfast platter for the real culprits – refined carbohydrates like sugar, maida, rice etc. As Anthony Komaroff (MD) writes in an article in the Harvard Health Publishing, “It matters greatly what you eat with your eggs. The saturated fat in butter, cheese, bacon, sausage, muffins, or scones, for example, raises your blood cholesterol much more than the cholesterol in your egg. And the highly refined “bad carbs” in white toast, pastries, home fries, and hash browns may also increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.” A balanced diet is important, insists Aggarwal. “And finally, what can be eaten and what can’t can vary on a case to case basis. There can’t be generalisations,” he says. ', 'So here’s hope yet, for Prithvi. He may indulge in his egg a day, if he can curb his love for sweets and stop himself from sneaking to the kitchen for a few after-dinner deserts in the middle of the night. And has his morning egg with a bowl of sprouts or just a single slice of bread (preferably multigrain, unbuttered and not topped with sugar).

The new system will also make it impossible to sponsor some categories of relatives.', 'There are 261,765 Indians waiting for family-sponsored Green cards and 306,601 (these are principal applicants; the number is more than half a million counting dependents) in the employment based queue, according to the US state department and the US citizenship and immigration services data. ', 'In all, there are 3.6 million and 395,025 in the two categories respectively.', '“We will replace the existing Green Card categories with a new visa, the Build America visa -- which is what we all want to hear,” the president said announcing his new “merit-based, high-security plan” Thursday. It seeks to overhaul legal immigration and bolster border security, including a wall.', 'The plan envisages a points-based immigration system that scores merit, age, professional skills, education and proficiency in English language over family ties.', '', 'Of the 1.1 million Green Cards issued every year, 66% go to relatives and 21% to asylum seekers and those picked in a visa lottery. Only 12% go to those seeking permanent residency through employment. President Trump intends to reverse that and take that 12% number to 57%, even higher.', 'If enacted into law, young, qualified, professional, English-speaking Indian applicants will stand a better chance of qualifying for Green Card, going forward, than those banking on familial ties to relatives such as children, spouses, siblings, parents, even grandparents.', 'But for those already in queue, experts said, it would be disastrous. Doug Rand, a former Obama White House official who worked on immigration and is co-founder of an immigration services company Boundless, said, “Although superficially beneficial for immigrants with more education and skills, this proposal could be disastrous for H-1B workers, most of whom are from India.”', 'First, he added, it would “pull the rug out from under the half-million or so skilled workers and their families” who are waiting for their Green Cards, because “they apparently they would all have to start over and reapply for the new ‘Build America visas’.” And, second, even if they managed, they will not be able to sponsor parents, adult children and siblings under the family-based category.', 'Stuart Andersen, an immigration expert who runs a non-partisan think-tank National Foundation for American Policy, said, “Indians with pending family-based Green Card applications would see those applications eliminated. Some Indians waiting for employment-based Green Cards might find a quicker path but since all employment-based Green Card applications would be eliminated anyone who doesn’t gain enough points under the system would eventually have to leave the United States.” And those who are American citizens will not be able to sponsor some relatives.', 'But the plan appears to have no future, not at least in its current avatar. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives that will have to pass the plan, have already come out against it. “This dead-on-arrival plan is not a remotely serious proposal,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement, and added, “To say that this plan’s application criteria are ‘merit-based’ is the height of condescension.” And, a big problem for them: the plan does not address the issue of “Dreamers”, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, several thousand of them are from India. ', 'President Trump acknowledged the plan’s uncertain future in his announcement remarks from the White House. “If for some reason -- possibly political -- we can’t get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the (2020) election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and, of course, hold the presidency,” he said.

Would it be accurate to say that this was a major motivator for your entry?', 'Actually, I think there were two different aspects to my deciding to be in politics. The first was that my view of myself, my life and its relationship to politics changed drastically. The second aspect was that I found myself watching silently as the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] was systematically destroying democratic institutions, enforcing a hate-filled political narrative and creating divisions among people for its own political advancement. I began to feel that remaining silent was cowardly. I didn’t know how to accept that cowardice. ', 'When Rahul Gandhi became vice-president of the party he gave the ‘power is poison’ speech; what words of advice did he or your mother give you when you entered politics? ', 'My brother’s advice was very clear. He told me that my job as a politician was to go to all those who are suffering, to find them, stand side-by-side with them, fight for them, and ensure that they had political representation in the system. My mother’s advice was that I talk too much and I should be more prudent about what I say.', 'Do you think that you “talked too much’’ at any point in this campaign? ', 'No, I don’t think so.', 'Do you think the Duryodhan comment against Prime Minister Narendra Modi was too much?', 'Absolutely not. I said very clearly that India has a history of not forgiving arrogance that dates back to the Mahabharat and in that context I quoted a famous poem about Duryodhan. What’s wrong with that? ', 'Did it make you angry when Mr Modi attacked your father? ', 'Not at all, I actually find the Prime Minister funny when he attacks my father because it shows that he is weak and has run out of substantial political arguments. ', 'If we talk about your current assignment in UP, you speak about the booth-level strengthening of the party. Is it feasible so soon? Is Priyanka Gandhi planning for 2019 or 2022? ', 'Clearly in three months, booth-level strengthening and rebuilding an entire political organisation in a state as complex as UP is not feasible. The aim in this election is to defeat the BJP. Where our organisation is weaker, we have ensured that our candidate does not damage the alliance [Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party]. However by 2022, it is completely feasible to build booth-level organisations though that is not the main focus of my assignment. My aim is to build representation in the party and to see to it that social groups, women and young people are adequately represented in our party. I think that is actually the deeper aspect of the task ahead of me. The booth level building of an organisation is only going to be a reflection of how well we manage to bring new life, new people and genuine ground level social, cultural and political leaders into our party. ', 'Did you reach out to Mayawati or Akhilesh Yadav to try to salvage an alliance?', 'My mother spoke to Mayawati ji, my brother reached out to both of them, and Mr Scindia [Jyotiraditya Scindia, also a general secretary of the Congress] reached out to Mr Akhilesh Yadav Ji a number of times. We were open to discussing an alliance right from the beginning, simply because we wanted to defeat the BJP in UP. However, for their own political reasons and in their own wisdom, both of them were unresponsive. They probably felt that it was not a feasible proposition for them, and therefore we are fighting alone. I think we have made as good a fight of it as we could have.', 'Many refer to you as Indira 2, referring to your grandmother Indira Gandhi. You invoke her too,why? What is the one similarity you have with her and something that differentiates you?', 'I don’t think it’s fair to say that I invoke her. I speak about her when I feel it’s relevant to speak about her. Just because she is my grandmother, I cannot pretend that she does not exist. She was a prime minister of India and she did a lot of phenomenal work for the country, and as a Congresswoman it is but obvious that I should speak about her.

How can anyone compare me with her? I just entered politics three months ago! ', 'Similarity and difference…?', 'My grandmother was a revolutionary and a fighter, I am just a fighter. Maybe the similarity is that once we make up our minds to fight for something we believe in, we will fight to the end.

Amidst all the hullaballoo which is just a way of life these days, the frenetic and fickle nature of T20s feels like a calm, it is where skills, talent and temperament with the bat, ball and in the field matter the most.

While CSK controlled proceedings once again with an economy of 8.1 (From overs 16-20), KKR were the worst with 10.78. RCB were forever floundering as they leaked runs at 10.49, Mumbai Indians, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals were quite consistent with 9.65, 8.92 and 9.03 respectively.', 'So while the batsmen hog all the headlines and accolades, this season was once again a reminder that a side powers through only when the bowlers are able and willing.', 'Remember the times batsmen scoring more than 400 runs was considered to be a privilege, their careers would take off after such a ‘stellar’ season, perhaps even a callup to the national side was on the cards. All fair results, except this season, there were 16 batsmen with more than 400 runs against their name. Four of them screamed past 500 and one David Warner was flying at 692 when he had to return to Australia to wear that national jersey after one whole year. Yes, this melody was intense, riveting and so skilful!', 'For all their bowling woes, Kings XI Punjab was the most consistent batting side, well as far as their average of 31.43 suggest.

Ravindra Jadeja argued, MS Dhoni walked back on the field, he had an animated discussion with the umpire and in this case, those very rules of the game were tossed aside and yet, there was not enough said and done about it.', 'And then there was Virat Kohli, trying to lead a side which was looking around for some hope. On good days Kohli is animated, pumping his fist, thumping his chest, and this season was not good. He was vocal, not quite parliamentary and had to conjure up excuses after every loss. The umpire missed a no ball very early in the season which many believe cost them the match and a possible slot in the playoff, so the skipper made it known that this was just not done and they were no playing ‘club cricket’. Well, but IPL is about clubs and franchises, pardon the words, Kohli was right about the appalling standard of umpiring right through the season, which needs to be discussed elsewhere.', 'World Cup squad – In and out, right and wrong', 'In the midst of all the madness, India’s World Cup squad was announced. There was no Ambati Rayudu, there was no Rishabh Pant. There was Dinesh Karthik and Vijay Shankar. Nothing was right or wrong, but debates followed. Pant, however, tried to swat away the disappointment much like the way he swatted away balls over mid-wicket and was an absolute joy to behold.

He redefined his batting, he redefined the way final few overs should be looked at. He has made all the right noises, and if Yuvraj Singh is to be believed, he can be the man who will be the difference in the upcoming World Cup. Yuvraj did a similar role back in 2011, so there is some thought behind this assessment.', 'Foreign contingent – Hit and miss', 'For David Warner, this was a watershed season, back after being banned for one year, he was a man possessed. Taking guard as the opener for Sunrisers Hyderabad, he was absolutely relentless. In 12 innings overall, he made 692 runs at 69.20, striking at 143.86, with one century and eight 50s. He was on fire, and well, Australia will sleep better.', 'Jonny Bairstow loved it in the IPL in his debut season.

However, for Ben Stokes, it was a disappointment and after the MVP performance for Pune in the first year, it has only been downhill for him. He mirrored Rajasthan’s performance all along the way.', 'And after all this, the highlight of the season was the madness, the power of Andre Russell, which was even more accentuated considering the lack of support from any other quarter. He changed as many as five games all by his own bat, he kept no one guessing when he said he wanted to bat higher up the order, he even drew flak for hitting out his skipper and management in public, but amidst all these shenanigans, Russell reminded us exactly why we love Caribbean cricket. Oh, well, and he is even in West Indies’ World Cup squad.', 'The final chapter', 'It was an evening of underperforming batting orders, underperforming fielding units, two tactically astute captains and jangling nerves. For CSK needed 150 for that fourth crown were cruising along, for Lasith Malinga, who is forever trying to prove his worth to his national team rocked up to bowl that final over. And it was after a harrowing night for him - 42 runs in the last 3 overs, a missed run out, a dropped catch and forever an immovable object in the field.', 'But here he was, with the white nut in his hand, kissed it and jogged forward, keeping in mind not to rupture the already creaking knees. And in the echoing silence, he was isolated and defended 9 off the final over. All this came, after his prodigy and now a star, Jasprit Bumrah had set it up perfectly for the stalwart to own the stage.', 'CSK were never meant to lose it, Mumbai were not going to lose it, there was technology which only added to the woes of the umpires and then there was that final hurrah.', 'Pollard hoisted Malinga on his shoulders – two veterans starred, two veterans combined to beat a team of veterans.

Can Mayawati become India’s first Dalit prime minister? ,2019-05-08, 09:26 IST,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/can-mayawati-become-india-s-first-dalit-prime-minister/story-CPIQeh7PvznvMm7r6dPtSP.html,"['It may have been a matter of informed speculation. But the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo, Mayawati, has now given her clearest indication yet that she is a contender for the post of the prime minister (PM). By declaring that, if all goes well, she will contest bypolls from Ambedkar Nagar — a constituency she has represented in the past — Ms Mayawati sent a signal to her support-base, the voters of the grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh (UP), other regional parties, the Congress and the nation at large that she wants the country’s top political job. With her ally, Samajwadi Party(SP)’s Akhilesh Yadav, claiming that the next PM will be from UP but not from Varanasi, he too has lent his support to Ms Mayawati’s prime ministerial ambitions.', 'It is truly a tribute to Indian democracy that a Dalit woman, leading what is a party of marginalised communities, can aspire to lead the country. It is an even more remarkable tribute to our electoral democracy — and its systems of checks and balances  — that a leader who had no seat in the last Lok Sabha and performed poorly in her own state assembly elections can become a serious contender for the post. To be sure, this is not the first time Ms Mayawati has thought of herself as the PM candidate. Riding high on the 2007 assembly victory in UP, she tried to bring together a constellation of regional and Left forces in the 2009 elections and projected herself as PM. On that occasion, she did not succeed.', 'But there is still a long road ahead for Ms Mayawati if she wants to realise her ambition this time around. For one, this will hinge on how well her alliance does in UP. The SP-BSP will have to truly decimate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and restrict it to fewer than 20 seats or so, for her claim to be taken seriously nationally. Second, she will need to win the support of other regional forces — from Mamata Banerjee to K Chandrashekar Rao, from Naveen Patnaik to Sharad Pawar, from Tejashwi Yadav to YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. And finally, even though she has fought bitterly against the Congress in this campaign, she will need to rebuild her bridges with Rahul Gandhi because the Congress will be a decisive player in any non-BJP formation. This will not be easy as the Congress sees her as a competitor for Dalit votes in UP as well as in the rest of the country. The arithmetic aside, if Ms Mayawati is truly serious about her claim, it is also time for her to start sharing her national vision and outlining a set of policies that she would push as the PM. It is only when she has both numbers and credibility on her side that she can hope to pull off in 2019 what she could not in 2009.

During the prime minister’s visit, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said Odisha deserves “special category status” for being the most disaster-prone state in India. His demand is understandable. A Super Cyclone flattened the state in 1999; in 2013, Odisha was hit by Cyclone Phailin, and in 2018 by Cyclone Titli. In 2019, it was Cyclone Fani. ', 'While the first one killed more than 10,000 people, the death toll in the next three was below 100, thanks to the state’s improved disaster management skills. Besides these major disruptions, Odisha also had to deal with other climate-induced disasters such as heat waves, droughts, and floods. Such episodes are expected to increase in the future. The Fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2015) report predicts that India and other tropical countries will witness an increasing number of cyclones, storm surges and extreme rainfall in the future. ', 'While the Patnaik government did well to weather Cyclone Fani — the state mobilised resources and personnel to evacuate more than a million people — and save lives, the challenges ahead of the state now will be equally gargantuan. “While restoring infrastructure will be one aspect of the challenge, rebuilding lives of poor people, especially the vulnerable category, will be a much greater one. This will need some smart and long-term thinking on the part of the government,” said Amar Nayak, a disaster management expert, and ActionAid’s Global Humanitarian Adviser.  ', 'In February, members of the People’s Solidarity Forum, a state-level forum of people’s organisations from 14 districts of Odisha, released a manifesto that focused on exactly that: Long-term planning to improve disaster management and response, mitigation, and building resilience of coastal communities. These proposals can also be considered by India’s other coastal cities that don’t yet have a plan to tackle such events. ', 'One of the interesting suggestions in the manifesto is to develop a cadre of people who know how to swim, can fix electrical networks, drive speed boats, all of which are important skills in disaster situations, and then improve their skills further so that they can supplement the state’s efforts during such calamities. ', 'Second, there has to be a mapping of the most vulnerable population — single women, senior citizens, children, pregnant women, the physically challenged,Dalits — in villages and cities to ensure that they are rescued first. Third, regular disaster risk reduction trainings must be done.  Fourth, such disasters also mean loss of daily wages for poor people. It is critical to ensure that social protection programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme are implemented well so that people can resume their normal lives sooner rather than later. Fifth, each cyclone is also an ecological disaster, and all efforts must be made to regenerate nature’s own disaster managers, such as mangroves. ', '“Mangrove forests act as a buffer or shock absorber in time of such disasters. There is a clear indication that mangroves at Sundarbans saved Kolkata from Cyclone Aila in 2009, by absorbing a massive chunk of the cyclone’s fury,” Indian Forest Service officer, Parveen Kaswan, recently wrote in a blog. ', 'Unfortunately, the people who run India’s coastal cities are waging a war on these natural barriers. Take the example of Mumbai. A 2018 December report in Hindustan Times reported that mangrove destruction cases doubled in 2018, but there was not even one conviction. India’s financial capital should be careful becauseclimate change can increase cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea. ', 'Sixth, while a major portion of the focus after a disaster is on rural areas, there is a need to provide for the urban poor in cities. They need safe shelter, livelihood options with skill building and social security. Badly constructed buildings can be killers as much as cyclones and earthquakes. There is an urgent need to invest not just in cyclone shelters but also in cyclone-resilient construction, as per the Model Building Bye Laws, 2016, of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. ', 'Non-profits such as Save the Children have also raised the need to ensure psychological counselling for children to overcome such climate tragedies. ', 'Last, but not least, all Indian cities need city-level disaster management plans. Unfortunately, as most city governments struggle to deal with other day-to-day challenges such as education, infrastructure and health, climate resilience and adaptation figure low on their list of priorities. ', 'Cyclone Fani is a warning for cities: Learn to be climate resilient or the consequences will be severe.', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 07, 2019 19:37 IST\n']"
Learning governance lessons from China,2019-05-07, 20:34 IST,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/learning-governance-lessons-from-china/story-T83oNbIeKsOHp4Wakj2aeP.html,"['The halfway point of this long drawn-out election season is a good time to step back and evaluate the performance of the Indian State, and how it can be improved. The comparison with China is illustrative. In 1981, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in China and India were comparable. By 2017, China’s GDP per capita was more than double that of India — despite India experiencing its years of fastest growth in this period. Further, service delivery failures of the sort widely seen in India — including high absence rates of government teachers and doctors — are rare in China.', 'How has non-democratic China delivered so much more for its citizens than democratic India? There are several explanations, including a greater embrace of market-led principles in the structure of the economy, focusing on export-led manufacturing in labour-intensive sectors and achieving economies of scale in production, and delivering high quality basic education and health. However, in this piece, I want to focus less on “what” China does to be so successful, and more on the “why” and reflect on the implications for India. ', 'Specifically, the most important point that India would do well to learn from China is the centrality of incentives and accountability for political leaders and officials to deliver improved outcomes at all levels of the Chinese government. At the highest levels, there is a near obsessive focus on jobs, growth and development — way more so than in India. ', 'The reason is that governments obtain legitimacy through a combination of process and performance. Indian democracy provides governments considerable process-based legitimacy, based on winning elections. Thus, no one questions why a government is in power. However, in the absence of elections, the main source of legitimacy of the Chinese government comes from performance and delivering improving living standards. Thus, counter-intuitively, the non-democratic Chinese regime is more paranoid about improving the welfare of citizens than the democratically elected Indian government. In China, poor performance can lead to social unrest, and potentially even a revolution. In India, the worst thing that can happen to a non-performing government is getting voted out, and public employees are mostly unaffected.', 'The focus on performance at the highest levels of the Chinese government has, in turn, led to much greater investments in State capacity and building an effective machinery for governance and service delivery. In particular, there is great emphasis placed on measuring, monitoring, and rewarding performance of officials at all levels. Promotion prospects for lower-level party officials as well as public employees are linked to performance. Such a structure both improves incentives to perform at all levels of the government, and also leads to higher-performing officials and politicians getting promoted.', 'It is easy to attribute China’s success to having a “strong” State. This would be a mistake. Some of the greatest man-made disasters in the second half of the 20th century — including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution — happened when China was a “strong” State under Mao Zedong. Rather the under-appreciated lesson from China is that it started performing better when Deng Xiaoping’s reforms made it a more “accountable” State. ', 'Indian democracy provides “expressive utility” to voters by allowing political preferences to be expressed, and the courts and civil society provide some protection against government overreach. But, it has not delivered enough in making leaders and officials accountable for performance. There are at least two broad sets of reforms that will help in achieving this goal.', 'The first is meaningful decentralisation of budgets, and authority to local tiers of government — especially cities. This needs to be combined with direct elections of empowered mayors. Moving the locus of political accountability closer to the level where services are delivered will improve democratic incentives for service delivery, and also create a performance-based pipeline for senior leadership positions. It is worth recalling that Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad started their government careers as mayors of Allahabad, Ahmedabad, and Patna.', 'The second is a serious effort to improve the functioning of the Indian State with a focus on measurement of outcomes and to link the career progression of officials to objective measures of performance. Global research on management quality has identified personnel policy — hiring, training, postings, pay, and promotion — as the most important determinant of organisational effectiveness. High-performing organisations are characterised by autonomy to front-level officials on how to deliver, combined with accountability for outcomes. The Chinese State has deeply internalised this insight. The Indian State does the exact opposite — with micromanagement of processes, but limited accountability for outcomes. ', 'While we are rightly proud of our democracy, there is much to introspect and learn from how the Chinese State has created accountable administrative structures that have delivered meaningfully better outcomes for its citizens.
