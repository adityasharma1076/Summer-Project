Fortunately, there are numerous opportunities for students with varied aptitudes and interests,” said Amrita Dass, educationist and career consultant.', '“Those who don’t wish to pursue undergraduate academic degrees can choose from a range of professional programmes in management, defence services, law, hotel management, travel and tourism, culinary arts, mass communication, fine/applied art, design, animations, social work and elementary education for a bachelor’s degree,” she said.', 'There is no dearth of students who scored around 90% and still cracked all India level competitive examination.', 'Gunjan Dwivedi of Lucknow had secured ninth rank in the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), the result of which was declared last month. She passed ISC in commerce stream with about 91% from Loreto Convent in 2011 and graduated with political science (honours) from Delhi University’s Daulta Ram College.', '“Marks are important but not the only parameter to measure one’s academic excellence. What matters is how you fare in all India competitions like UPSC and JEE Advanced,” said Gunjan who did not even clear the first stage in her previous two attempts in UPSC but got 9th rank this year.', 'Miss India 2016 second runner-up and Lucknow girl Pankhuri Gidwani had scored 97.25% in the ISC examination 2017. A student of La Martiniere Girls’ College, Lucknow she could not appear in the board examination in 2016 because of various reasons.', 'Principal of La Martiniere Girls’ College, Lucknow, Aashrita Dass said, “While I am glad students are making us proud by securing high grades, I firmly believe that those children who are not in the 90% bracket are also achievers. ', 'There are so many children out there who have been average in academics but have outdone themselves in various fields,” she said.', '“I feel success should not be measured by ‘all that glitters’. True success lies in compassion, empathy, persistence and love. May we raise our children to be passionate and to give their best,” she said.', 'While commending the outstanding achievement of toppers, Amrita Dass said, “I want to reassure students who did not get high grades that the Board cut-off eligibility percentage to appear for most competitive exams ranges between 45% (eg CLAT) to 60% (eg 5-year Integrated Management Programme at IIM, Indore and Rohtak). Here you are tested for your general mental ability.”', 'Also, many renowned universities globally had started taking into consideration the co-curricular and other beyond - the - classroom accomplishments of students rather than just the Board results. Some even had a separate extracurricular and sports quota for those who excelled in these, she said.', 'Prof Geeta Gandhi Kingdon, president of City Montessori School said, “It is regrettable that exam boards have been inflating marks in the name of ‘moderation’. While it is important for education policy makers to ensure a fairer assessment system, it is also important for parents to understand that many people with seemingly mediocre marks go on to attain great success in life.”', '“Schools must provide an education which not only narrowly consists of academic learning that is assessed by board exams (the visible part of the ‘iceberg’), but also a broad-based experience that leads to personal development – the major portion below the visible tip of the iceberg,” Kingdon ', 'said.

Time to start winning at the top: Saurav Ghosal,2019-05-19, 09:06,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/time-to-start-winning-at-the-top-saurav-ghosal/story-wfmjMa6dBTVveMdvITJ2UJ.html,"['If Saurav Ghosal could choose his last supper, it would be mutton biryani, Kolkata style. “The potato is optional but not the boiled egg,” he says, breaking with the established norm.', 'Being a foodie with a sweet tooth—“I get that from my mom,” he says—doesn’t make it easy for the world No. 10, but when you are aspiring to be in the top five, win “a massive, massive event”, and leave a legacy, you learn to avoid temptations. Especially because at 32 you have a “certain amount of time left in the game.” Ideally, till the next Commonwealth Games and Asian Games (both in 2022).', '“Being a professional squash player and doing well is not just about how good a player you are,” Ghosal says. “It’s about everything that comes with it: how you are training, how you get out of bed when you don’t want to, how you take care of yourself, your ability to mentally stay there when things aren’t going brilliantly. You call yourself a professional athlete for a reason, otherwise you are just an athlete.”', 'To elucidate his point, Ghosal talks about his third-round exit at El Gouna International Open (Egypt) in April, which followed a quarter-final loss at Macau Open the same month.', '“It had been a long season and I was probably a bit jaded mentally.” Soon after came the Asian Individual Squash Championship in Kuala Lumpur.', '“Somehow I turned it around and my mental space was a lot better in the Asian championships and that is why the level of squash I produced was better,” Ghosal says. So, the moral of the story is to persevere because if you are true to what you are doing, at some point it is going to turn around. You also have to be smart about it, like reining yourself in just a little bit at training so that you can release when you really need to.”', 'We are inside the 225-year-old Calcutta Racket Club, a two-storey bungalow tucked between a cathedral and a planetarium, where Ghosal learnt the ropes. The squish of shoes on courts and the whiplash of a racket making the soft, dark ball crash into the wall with a dull thud provide the setting for the conversation with the newly-minted Asia champion on a brief stopover at home before the blue riband British Open, where he starts against world No. 4 Karim Gawad of Egypt on Tuesday.', 'The big jump', 'Ghosal, who turned pro in 2003, had been on the fringes of the big-time for a few years. Five Mays ago, he was world No. 15.', '“There is a big jump to be made, squash-wise, mentality-wise and obviously the ability to do it week in and week out. Those three things took me that much time,” he says. “Since September last year it has been something I have been sort of building towards, something that happily happened for me on April 1 when I made the top 10.”', 'Crucial to the jump was signing up with Australian David Palmer, a former world No. 1 who lives in Ithaca, New York, and also trains world No. 2 Mohamed Elshorbagy of Egypt.', '“I have the basic stuff, the foundation in place. How we can make that more lethal? How can we manage to do that at a higher intensity and more consistently against people who are my level and just below and also to be able to do that against players who are higher than I am? Those were the key points we discussed. There were tactical and technical adjustments too but those are very small. Also, there is greater focus on gameplans being individualised. So I think the level of detail is more than what it was two or five years back,” he says.', 'Ghosal is the second oldest in the top-10 though there are a few bunched in their 30s.', '“Different people have different trajectories. Tarek Momen, for example, is world No. 3 and he is 31 and he has matured really well over the last one-and-a-half, two years. At nearly 37, Greg (former world No. 1 Gregory Gaultier) would have been in the top 10 but is injured. If I didn’t think I had an equal shout of making top 5 as Diego Elias (who is 22 and world No. 8), I wouldn’t be playing today.”', 'Watching art happen', 'It was when he became the junior world No. 1 that Ghosal thought he would make squash his calling. It would mean travelling to Leeds to train with Malcolm Willstrop because Ghosal liked the way Malcom’s son James (a former world No. 1) played.', '“You have the idea of a conservative English player who is effective but not flamboyant. James was anything but. When I first saw him in the world juniors in Chennai in 2002, it was like watching art happen. Of course, the accuracy of James, no one probably in the history of the game has it but I would like to think I am close. That made me say I want to go and train with Malcolm,” he says.', 'He landed in Leeds in September when it was cold and he was miserable. For someone whose only visit to the kitchen prior to that was to put bread in a toaster, life was hard.', '“But going to Malcolm, going to the Pontefract Squash and Leisure Club where I train, I have made friends for life. The relationship I have with Malcolm is beyond words,” he says. Ghosal had looked at three years when he first went to Leeds. He ended up staying for eight.', 'In 2013 Leeds was swapped for Kolkata and Chennai as bases.', '“I want to live in India, always did. I want to do things in India. I could do stuff in Europe and USA but that doesn’t really interest me. So since I was going to be happier when I am here, I took on the travel bit.”', 'Bit? He goes to Leeds for training, to Ithaca for more training, and is often on the road alone for weeks.', 'Ghosal’s wife Diya, a graphic designer, is squash ace Dipika Pallikal Karthik’s sister, but she isn’t very interested in the sport.', '“We have other things to talk about. We are interested in art, we are foodies and love travelling.”', 'Diya has been to only one tournament where he played, in Switzerland last March. “She didn’t come to the games because she was too stressed.” Ghosal lost in the quarter-final.', 'Art is important for the multiple Asian Games medallist.', '“I want to win in a way that people enjoy watching me do it. That adds to your legacy. Yes the legacy is there in terms of me being an Indian player but what can I do to make that legacy on the world stage? That is what keeps me going.”', 'Tradition missed', 'Ghosal said while the scene has improved in India—there are about 800 playing the junior national championships, up from 300 in his time, but Egypt, which has five players in the top 10, would have that many in a local tournament. “And when you train with world champions daily, it is an experience that no amount of coaching or watching videos can substitute,” he says.', 'He missed that. “If I had a richer tradition in India to look up to, maybe then the expectations would have been higher and maybe that would have pushed me more. But I am a better player and person today because of what I have learnt over all those years.”', 'When he started, Ghosal said he was asked to aim for the top 30 because Ritwik Bhattacharya had got to a high of world No. 38. “When I passed him (in January 2009), I told myself that I would take it any day that I was five in the world and he was three in the world.”', 'Ghosal said his first thought on winning the British Open juniors (2004) was that “now an Indian will know it can be done.”', 'What’s changed from then is that boys now know what it takes to be in the top 10. “Now we are competing at the top end. The next step will be to start winning at the top end.”', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 19, 2019 08:33 IST\n']"

Skirts never seem to go out of style, right from the first time a denim mini skirt came around in the early 2000s to just this April when Gwen Stefani stepped out in it like it’s always been the relevant fashion choice.', 'The best part about how skirts exist in fashion is that in the ancient times, skirts or garments that looked like skirts were worn by both women and men. But over the years, it essentially became a girl’s garment. The Victorian era saw elaborate full-length dresses, but skirts and blouses became a trend in the Edwardian times. ', 'Over decades, the silhouettes, hemlines and structures of the skirt have changed in keeping with the shift in cultural as well as economical changes (remember how the hemlines were longer during the great depression?). Trends such as the miniskirt that was invented way back in 1960 or even bohemian peasant skirts that made their first appearance in 1970s still find relevance in today’s wardrobe choices.', 'So, why are women flaunting them so generously now? “Fashion and feminism are connected. Wearing pants earlier on was about who controlled things at work and at home, which is changing. Women are no longer feeling the need to wear pants to imply they are in charge. The return of the skirt is also indicative of the change of mindset that wearing a skirt means being meek. You can wear a skirt, embrace your femininity and still be the boss!” says celebrity stylist Rishi Raj.', 'And now that men have started to wear skirts, the interest has revived and they’ve become cooler and mainstream! “Rohit Bal had first put out the idea of men in skirts on the runway, then Ranveer Singh made a statement with it and now Will Smith’s son Jaden Smith is seen wearing a lot of skirts,” adds Rishi.

To grey or not to grey,2019-05-18, 22:56,https://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/to-grey-or-not-to-grey/story-XIjsevRa5AtKQxzejTynJP.html,"['I am pretty sure everyone reading this is familiar with the phrase ‘silver fox’. But to err on the side of safety, allow me to explain that it is used to refer to handsome men of a certain age who are going grey, and looking better with every strand that turns white.', 'The original poster boy of the ‘silver fox’ brigade was Richard Gere, who was grey even when he was young and should by rights have had a full head of black hair. Since then, the mantle has passed on to George Clooney, who has embraced grey hair (and now a grey beard) along with his sex symbol status. And over the years, such silver foxes as John Slattery (who played Roger Sterling in Mad Men) and Alec Baldwin (30 Rock and more recently, SNL) have had their moment in the sun – or should that be moon?', 'So what, you ask, is the female alternative to ‘silver fox’? What do we call a woman who is growing older, embracing her grey hair, and looking amazing as a consequence?', 'Well, the short answer to that is: there is no such corresponding phrase. And what’s even more disheartening is that it is difficult to find famous women in the world of movies, media or even politics who have decided to go grey with age and look glamorous while doing so. (All I could come up with was Theresa May, and you will agree, there is nothing remotely foxy about her.)', 'If you look at TV news, then on the international channels you have a fair smattering of ‘silver foxes’. Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer on CNN, for instance, have been white-haired for as long as I can remember. Back home, Rajdeep Sardesai has begun greying at a rapid pace, and now has more white hair than black (as does Karan Thapar).', 'But channel surf one evening and see if you can find even one female anchor who is greying with the years. There are plenty of women in their 40s on news television who should – in the natural course – have a smattering of grey in their hair. But every major female anchor across channels has impeccably-coloured hair, sometimes with the addition of a few glamorous highlights or lowlights.', 'In politics, too, the number of women who are unapologetically grey are few and far between. Sonia Gandhi has been slowly greying over the last few years, and Sheila Dikshit has had salt and pepper hair for decades now. But that’s about it, I think. Mayawati, Mamata Banerjee, Sushma Swaraj, Nirmala Sitharaman, Maneka Gandhi, Sumitra Mahajan, all of them sport a full head of black hair (natural or not, I leave it to your imagination). In the last Parliament, the only woman I can think of who sported grey hair with aplomb was Jaya Bachchan.', 'That’s not to say that women are not embracing greying in the wider world. You only have to check out the hashtag #goinggrey on Instagram to see some awesome women rocking their grey, salt and pepper, or white hair. But these women are still seen as outliers, the standard being women who don’t let a single strand of white show and monitor their roots with an iron discipline, checking in for colour treatments every four to six weeks.', 'I have to admit that this gender disparity in going grey doesn’t really surprise me. In the world we live in, there is far greater pressure on women to look good than there is on men. And in our culture, looking good has come to mean looking young, especially for women (women with white hair=old; men with white hair=distinguished). So, making the decision to let nature take its own course where your hair is concerned takes a bit of courage.', 'But I am getting the sense that this is beginning to change. I see many women around me saying yes to grey hair, and loving the way it looks on them. My sister is among them, though her decision was spurred by a medical emergency that left her with shaved head. When her hitherto-dyed hair grew back in an interesting shade of salt and pepper, she decided to keep it. It’s snow white now, and she looks absolutely amazing with it.', 'Would I be able to rock the same look, I often wonder. I am not sure just how much grey I do have – those six-weekly visits for a ‘root touch-up’ mean that I will never know for sure – and whether it will look as good on me as it does on her.', 'But the reason I can’t see myself going grey is more fundamental than that. The black-haired (with just a hint of auburn highlights) image of myself that I see looking back at me in the mirror seems the best version of myself. That woman looks the way I feel. And unless that feeling changes, the hair won’t either.', 'I will, as the saying does not go, dye another day. And then another.

Lethal in attack, purposeful in defence, goal shielded by one of the best keepers in the contemporary game, a blur of slick pass-and-go movement, this Manchester City team may have the financial muscle to buy any player it likes, but that is not the sole reason for its spellbinding success over the past two seasons.

It is a tribute to Liverpool that it went toe-to-toe with this City side and never once blinked. This Liverpool side, too, should be in the mix when the GOAT conversation comes around.', 'The emergence of these two teams changes the dynamic of the Premier League. It creates a new duopoly. Behind City’s 98 points and Liverpool’s 97, third placed Chelsea has 72 points; Tottenham in fourth has 71; and Arsenal in fifth has 70. The gulf between the top two and the best of the rest is vast. And it does not look like changing in the near future.', 'Both teams have recruited wisely, covering deficiencies they had in every position. Both are brimming with talented, young players who will perform at their peak for years. Both have deep bench strength. (City, for instance, barely missed Kevin de Bruyne, its best player of 2017-18, when his season this time around was blighted by injury.) And both can dine at European football’s top table. Liverpool has proved this by reaching the Champions League final on two successive occasions. City, as yet, have not enough to show for itself in that regard, but that will surely change. In fact, with big rebuilds impending in European giants such as Real Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich, the change in City’s fortunes in Europe should come sooner rather than later.', 'No other team in England can hope to catch these two.', 'Not since Manchester United and Arsenal ignited and sustained one of the fiercest rivalries in the history of the Premier League in the late 1990s and early 2000s has the division had a duopoly. But City and Liverpool have established their holds on the top flight. Neither will go away. It is easy to see them leave the rest of the competition further behind.', 'Is that a good thing or a bad thing? ', 'Well, it makes the Premier League similar to the leagues in Spain or Germany or Italy or France, which are dominated by one or two sides (in Spain, perhaps three if Atletico Madrid has a good season). This dual dominance rids the Premier League of some of its unpredictability and enduring ability to surprise.', 'At the same time, the prospect of watching two genuinely great sides flaunt their stuff week after week is a thrill and a joy. A gripping rivalry between two high-calibre sides elevates sport to its most rarefied realm.', 'Spinoff appears every fortnight', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 18, 2019 18:22 IST\n']"

He was awake, but he did not know that. A rescue party at the 2019 Dakar Rally found him some 200km from Moquegua, the starting point of the fifth stage on route to Arequipa, stunned by a concussion injury. He was airlifted and admitted to a hospital in Tacna, in southern Peru near the Chile border, with back and hip injuries. That was in January.', 'The 35-year-old off-road rally biker from Bengaluru, however, has no memory of the crash and what followed. ', '“I had hit my head and apparently was awake the whole time. I thought I had passed out. I have no recollection. I had no idea I lay there for that long,” Santosh says calmly.', '“You need to gamble with life. This is a sport where you need to take risks. This is not a game point, make mistakes and learn from there.”', 'Dakar, the toughest, most celebrated rally in the world, demands riders to stand crouched over on the bikes for better part of the fast stretches. Standing up helps the rider get a better view of what’s coming—loose rocks, slush, deep sand, holes in the dune—while zooming at over 90kmph, the sand flying from the wheels. One lapse could be fatal, and serious injuries are par for the course. ', 'So far, the Dakar has claimed around 70 lives, 28 of them being competitors, apart from spectators and officials, in 41 editions.', 'Santosh is all scars. He wears them proudly. “In my whole career, I have been lucky to break the least number of bones. Guys at the same level have broken so many more,” he says. “But yeah, wrist, collar bone, my back a couple of times, hairline fractures... there have been some.”', 'The scar covering his neck looks like one massive tattoo that runs all the way to his shoulders. He acquired that one on his first attempt at cross country rallying. He had entered the 2013 Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge, an FIM Cross Country Rallies World Championship event, as a privateer on a shoestring budget. It meant his machine “was not where it needed to be”.', '“During the rally, a fuel leak...and it ignited and the bike went up in flames,” says Santosh. He just about managed to get away, with third degree burns on his neck and hands. Multiple surgeries followed. Pointing to his neck, he says: “This part is really vital because all the main veins run through here. So I am lucky I didn’t burn any of those. It was quite deep.” Next year, he finished in the top 10 at the same event, earning his first Dakar qualification.', 'Santosh also had a serious accident at the 2017 Desert Storm. Leading the pack through the fields in Rajasthan, Santosh snagged a barbed wire and crashed, dislocating a couple of vertebrae. But despite the injury, Santosh rode on through pain for the next three days only to lose his lead on the final day and finish third. “That was the last big crash I had because of which I had to get it operated and fuse my neck.”', 'But they were never a deterrent. “It’s like an artist who goes through his own process of self-loathing and joy,” Santosh says. “He experiences emotions that me and you cannot. For me it is the same, I am an artist but the canvas I choose is cross country rallying and the motorcycle is my way of expressing myself. That’s how I look at myself.”', 'Santosh’s concern post-Dakar was not the pain or recovery. He was more disappointed with the fact that 2019 was the second time in five appearances that he could not finish the rally. ', '“It was heartbreaking, especially when I had a lot of things going for myself. It took me a while to get back on my feet,” says Santosh after making a comeback in May at the Desert Storm in Rajasthan, his first event since Dakar. A multiple winner, the Hero rider finished second.', '“There was some issue with my back (after Dakar) which the doctors couldn’t pinpoint because with the nerves, it’s a little more complicated,” says Santosh, the first Indian to complete the Dakar, in 2015, on his first attempt. He finished 36th with a broken toe and injured shoulder. ', '“Now I am almost back to where I was last year. It will take me the rest of the year to come back to form.”', 'By form he means getting ready for his sixth attempt at the Dakar early next year in Saudi Arabia. “My journey only started when I completed the Dakar because if I didn’t I wouldn’t have the life that I have today,” Santosh says. “Today the goal is to be competitive, reach and be among those top guys. I am not saying I am going to win. But I am the guy who can break the threshold. That is what I want to do, make a name by being competitive and not just the guy who finishes.” ', 'When not near a bike, Santosh enjoys reading books, especially autobiographies, and particularly liked Abhinav Bindra’s ‘A Shot at History’. Of late, he has developed a passion for surfing. “I always wanted to surf so I learnt it recently and will pursue it now. It complements what I do on motorcycles,” he says. “On motorcycles everything is about the rush but when you are surfing you have to actually wait it out in the ocean for the right waves. I love it, need to go out and do more of that.”', 'Spending time with his parents and four dogs at their family farm house in Kolar, about 70km from Bengaluru, is another of his favourite past times. There, he also runs the Big Rock Dirt Park a three-track facility for off-road riding.', '“It brings people to my world, gives them a chance to learn off-road skills and (for) me to spot talent,” he says.', '“I want to do to off-roading what (Pullela) Gopichand did to badminton.” ', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 18, 2019 08:24 IST\n']"

And this is the thing with melody, it was perfectly captured by Nietzche, the German philosopher: “The end of a melody is not its goal: but nonetheless, had the melody not reached its end it would not have reached its goal either.”', 'Make no mistake, the Indian Premier League is a melody, it captivates you, it makes you slip into a sense of unconsciousness, it can often force you to wake up from an extended slumber, and yet, for the jarring beats all around it, the product is inherently a melody - which cannot end, it just pauses, with a promise to surface again, to grab hold of your attention, all over again.', 'That this was the 12th season, that the games were longer, that players were more agitated, officials were under more scrutiny and results were down to the proverbial wire – everything added up and without any cuts, edits, and screenplay, it was enchanting, the action was surreal and it was immersing.', '8 teams with refurbished squads, with new mentors, coaches, captains and tactics at the helm jumped in, and when the final four remained, it proved to be the closest season ever. 1 point was the difference between the wooden spoon holders and the fourth team to make it to the playoffs.', 'ALSO\u2009READ: Rohit-Malinga plan decoded: MI captain reveals discussion before final ball', 'IPL, as a product, loves itself, it gloats about its grandeur, almost commands you to fall in love too, and while, it receives its own share of flak, it just shrugs its shoulders and blitzes on. The arrogance can be off-putting for some, but in this contemporary world, where narcissism has become a synonym of confidence, it passes you by and forces you to sit, look at it, and march along.', 'However, for all the blaring ads, the often-disconcerting billboards, the vanity of brands falling head over heels to jostle for places on the jerseys, it is inherently a league which believes in good cricket, balance between bat and ball, and where players are allowed to take prominence and dictate the state of affairs. Amidst all the hullaballoo which is just a way of life these days, the frenetic and fickle nature of T20s feels like a calm, it is where skills, talent and temperament with the bat, ball and in the field matter the most. Scratch the surface and you will find that players have driven this model all these years, they play with their heart and soul, which translates into even contests, which then filters out to attract even more crowds and attention and lo and behold, the mollahs follow!', 'This season was no different and yet, this season was unique. An equal purse and an open auction too contributed.', 'It was no different because Royal Challengers Bangalore started sprinting when the race had ended, it was no different because Rajasthan Royals never heard the starting whistle, it was no different because Kings XI Punjab started like a flash and ended like a flash in the pan, it was no different because Kolkata Knight Riders were out of breath very soon because they started in such a huff.', 'And yet it was unique, because finally we were able to see the real Delhi (Capitals and no Daredevils) make a fist of things, it was unique because Mumbai Indians did not want to leave things to final week, it was unique because Sunrisers Hyderabad stumbled more often than not and yet, with only 12 points, for the first time in history, scraped through.', 'Also, there was Chennai Super Kings, a team which could well have started in the finals, and watched other teams scramble around.', 'ALSO\u2009READ: CSK coach hints changes in ‘ageing’ Chennai Super Kings squad', 'Bowlers win you tournaments and this season vindicated it perfectly', 'Chennai Super Kings owe their success mainly to MS Dhoni and the way he handled the bowlers. The batting was mediocre at best, but CSK have made best use of their home conditions to have four of their bowlers among the top 15 wicket-takers of the tournament. Delhi Capitals were excellent too, Kagiso Rabada lit up the IPL with his bowling and along with Ishant Sharma in the Powerplays, Delhi were a force and a half. Mumbai Indians had perhaps the most-settled bowling attack and five of their bowlers claimed ten wickets each.', 'Rashid Khan did not get enough wickets this season, Bhuvneshwar Kumar too was not as successful, but they were not very expensive and with the addition of Khaleel Ahmed, they were smart and hence, in the playoffs.', 'We take a look at how the teams fared in the powerplay overs:', 'CSK never allowed the opposition to get off the hook, as they bossed this phase with the best bowling average of 29.65 while going at 7.83 runs per over. Kings XI and Royal Challengers Bangalore suffered in this phase as they averaged 65.58 and 50.71, and taking only 12 and 14 wickets respectively. A certain indication of where they slipped, a certain cause of worry and one that needs to be plugged in the next season.', 'And now we see how these teams fared in the death overs, where a majority of the games are dictated. While CSK controlled proceedings once again with an economy of 8.1 (From overs 16-20), KKR were the worst with 10.78. RCB were forever floundering as they leaked runs at 10.49, Mumbai Indians, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals were quite consistent with 9.65, 8.92 and 9.03 respectively.', 'So while the batsmen hog all the headlines and accolades, this season was once again a reminder that a side powers through only when the bowlers are able and willing.', 'Remember the times batsmen scoring more than 400 runs was considered to be a privilege, their careers would take off after such a ‘stellar’ season, perhaps even a callup to the national side was on the cards. All fair results, except this season, there were 16 batsmen with more than 400 runs against their name. Four of them screamed past 500 and one David Warner was flying at 692 when he had to return to Australia to wear that national jersey after one whole year. Yes, this melody was intense, riveting and so skilful!', 'For all their bowling woes, Kings XI Punjab was the most consistent batting side, well as far as their average of 31.43 suggest. KL Rahul, who looked sublime, aesthetic and a million dollars, peeled off 593 runs all by himself.', 'And then there was KKR, a side which hinged around Andre Russell and then later found out Shubman Gill. They averaged 30.15, but were ousted, and like they say, batsmen can only win you matches, bowlers win you tournaments.', 'RCB were last because coupled with their bowling woes were their shortcomings with the bat. There was Virat Kohli, there was AB de Villiers and yet there was disappointment. An average of 25.34 is just not enough when the bowlers never found their rhythm all through the season.', 'Well, Kagiso Rabada had the purple cap, before Imran Tahir eclipsed him in the final, David Warner the orange one and yet, Delhi Capitals and Sunrisers Hyderabad were not in the finals. Mumbai Indians made it, they beat CSK thrice on the road and well, if CSK start their IPL campaigns from the playoffs, who would actually mind?', 'Have you noticed the pattern, it probably would have missed you, because year after year, the pattern is the same. Controlled bowling, strategic batting and tactically smart captaincy. The elements have been different this year, but the pattern is still the same.', 'ALSO\u2009READ: Better than MS Dhoni: Rohit becomes IPL’s most successful player', 'Flashpoints and frayed tempers', 'R Ashwin is a thinking cricketer, he is feisty, and he never shies away from a challenge. Hence, when he paused, waited for Jos Buttler to meander out of his crease and took off the bails, it sparked off a row. ‘Mankad’ was the buzzword, there were polarising opinions, not for Ashwin, who shrugged it off as one of those things which just happened because it is written in black on a white sheet of paper known as the rules of the game.', 'Zoom ahead, MS Dhoni has been dismissed, CSK are in a bit of a hole, Mitchell Santner faces a ball, it was above the waist, the umpire outstretched his hand, and then rescinded the decision. Ravindra Jadeja argued, MS Dhoni walked back on the field, he had an animated discussion with the umpire and in this case, those very rules of the game were tossed aside and yet, there was not enough said and done about it.', 'And then there was Virat Kohli, trying to lead a side which was looking around for some hope. On good days Kohli is animated, pumping his fist, thumping his chest, and this season was not good. He was vocal, not quite parliamentary and had to conjure up excuses after every loss. The umpire missed a no ball very early in the season which many believe cost them the match and a possible slot in the playoff, so the skipper made it known that this was just not done and they were no playing ‘club cricket’. Well, but IPL is about clubs and franchises, pardon the words, Kohli was right about the appalling standard of umpiring right through the season, which needs to be discussed elsewhere.', 'World Cup squad – In and out, right and wrong', 'In the midst of all the madness, India’s World Cup squad was announced. There was no Ambati Rayudu, there was no Rishabh Pant. There was Dinesh Karthik and Vijay Shankar. Nothing was right or wrong, but debates followed. Pant, however, tried to swat away the disappointment much like the way he swatted away balls over mid-wicket and was an absolute joy to behold. Perhaps, he could have been India’s X-factor in England, perhaps the selectors knew better, but the young man showed he has the game and possibly the temperament to control only what he can control.', 'Talking of controllable, Hardik Pandya was out of control - this time for all the right reasons. He redefined his batting, he redefined the way final few overs should be looked at. He has made all the right noises, and if Yuvraj Singh is to be believed, he can be the man who will be the difference in the upcoming World Cup. Yuvraj did a similar role back in 2011, so there is some thought behind this assessment.', 'Foreign contingent – Hit and miss', 'For David Warner, this was a watershed season, back after being banned for one year, he was a man possessed. Taking guard as the opener for Sunrisers Hyderabad, he was absolutely relentless. In 12 innings overall, he made 692 runs at 69.20, striking at 143.86, with one century and eight 50s. He was on fire, and well, Australia will sleep better.', 'Jonny Bairstow loved it in the IPL in his debut season. With Sunrisers Hyderabad this year, he raced away to his best T20 season ever, even topping the 2014 effort with Yorkshire, where he made 355 runs in 11 innings.', '445 runs in 10 innings and the very fact that SRH were manage to claw their way to the playoffs was down to the Warner-Bairstow impact at the top of the order.', 'Jofra Archer is finally an England player and his performances in the IPL continued to impress everyone. However, for Ben Stokes, it was a disappointment and after the MVP performance for Pune in the first year, it has only been downhill for him. He mirrored Rajasthan’s performance all along the way.', 'And after all this, the highlight of the season was the madness, the power of Andre Russell, which was even more accentuated considering the lack of support from any other quarter. He changed as many as five games all by his own bat, he kept no one guessing when he said he wanted to bat higher up the order, he even drew flak for hitting out his skipper and management in public, but amidst all these shenanigans, Russell reminded us exactly why we love Caribbean cricket. Oh, well, and he is even in West Indies’ World Cup squad.', 'The final chapter', 'It was an evening of underperforming batting orders, underperforming fielding units, two tactically astute captains and jangling nerves. For CSK needed 150 for that fourth crown were cruising along, for Lasith Malinga, who is forever trying to prove his worth to his national team rocked up to bowl that final over. And it was after a harrowing night for him - 42 runs in the last 3 overs, a missed run out, a dropped catch and forever an immovable object in the field.', 'But here he was, with the white nut in his hand, kissed it and jogged forward, keeping in mind not to rupture the already creaking knees. And in the echoing silence, he was isolated and defended 9 off the final over. All this came, after his prodigy and now a star, Jasprit Bumrah had set it up perfectly for the stalwart to own the stage.', 'CSK were never meant to lose it, Mumbai were not going to lose it, there was technology which only added to the woes of the umpires and then there was that final hurrah.', 'Pollard hoisted Malinga on his shoulders – two veterans starred, two veterans combined to beat a team of veterans. Well, it was supposed to be a format for the young turks – but then, well, melody does not quite bother about the artists performing, it is all about performance.', 'ALSO\u2009READ: ‘Now want to win World Cup,’ says Hardik Pandya after Mumbai Indians’ fourth IPL title', 'It will eventually fizzle out', 'Ahhh, the melody, this serene, soothing rhythm called cricket, was there to unite us all for 60 days, and even when it got desperate and even when a million sponsored awards kept spilling out, cricket - a simple game between bat and ball stood out and reminded us all about the inherent beauty. Mumbai Indians were the champions, Chennai Super Kings were champions too, IPL is a champion. So now, let it pause. Until we all dive into the madness all over again.', 'The frenzy will fizzle out, the evenings will find another context, and the IPL would be shunted away to a corner. Few whispers here, few movements there, but then it will all be background noise for the next 12 months, when it will finally erupt and force you to look at it and march along.', 'For now, since the melody never stops, let it pause!', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 13, 2019 14:21 IST\n']"
Can Mayawati become India’s first Dalit prime minister? ,2019-05-08, 09:26 IST,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/can-mayawati-become-india-s-first-dalit-prime-minister/story-CPIQeh7PvznvMm7r6dPtSP.html,"['It may have been a matter of informed speculation. But the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo, Mayawati, has now given her clearest indication yet that she is a contender for the post of the prime minister (PM). By declaring that, if all goes well, she will contest bypolls from Ambedkar Nagar — a constituency she has represented in the past — Ms Mayawati sent a signal to her support-base, the voters of the grand alliance in Uttar Pradesh (UP), other regional parties, the Congress and the nation at large that she wants the country’s top political job. With her ally, Samajwadi Party(SP)’s Akhilesh Yadav, claiming that the next PM will be from UP but not from Varanasi, he too has lent his support to Ms Mayawati’s prime ministerial ambitions.', 'It is truly a tribute to Indian democracy that a Dalit woman, leading what is a party of marginalised communities, can aspire to lead the country. It is an even more remarkable tribute to our electoral democracy — and its systems of checks and balances  — that a leader who had no seat in the last Lok Sabha and performed poorly in her own state assembly elections can become a serious contender for the post. To be sure, this is not the first time Ms Mayawati has thought of herself as the PM candidate. Riding high on the 2007 assembly victory in UP, she tried to bring together a constellation of regional and Left forces in the 2009 elections and projected herself as PM. On that occasion, she did not succeed.', 'But there is still a long road ahead for Ms Mayawati if she wants to realise her ambition this time around. For one, this will hinge on how well her alliance does in UP. The SP-BSP will have to truly decimate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and restrict it to fewer than 20 seats or so, for her claim to be taken seriously nationally. Second, she will need to win the support of other regional forces — from Mamata Banerjee to K Chandrashekar Rao, from Naveen Patnaik to Sharad Pawar, from Tejashwi Yadav to YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. And finally, even though she has fought bitterly against the Congress in this campaign, she will need to rebuild her bridges with Rahul Gandhi because the Congress will be a decisive player in any non-BJP formation. This will not be easy as the Congress sees her as a competitor for Dalit votes in UP as well as in the rest of the country. The arithmetic aside, if Ms Mayawati is truly serious about her claim, it is also time for her to start sharing her national vision and outlining a set of policies that she would push as the PM. It is only when she has both numbers and credibility on her side that she can hope to pull off in 2019 what she could not in 2009.

"Cyclone Fani: The worst is over, but picking up the pieces won’t be easy",2019-05-08, 09:26 IST,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/cyclone-fani-the-worst-is-over-but-picking-up-the-pieces-won-t-be-easy/story-SJfVLs6J6oW0SpFKnPKAjP.html,"['Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday conducted an aerial survey of Puri and Khurdha districts of Odisha to see for himself the scale of devastation caused by Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in the state on May 3. During the prime minister’s visit, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said Odisha deserves “special category status” for being the most disaster-prone state in India. His demand is understandable. A Super Cyclone flattened the state in 1999; in 2013, Odisha was hit by Cyclone Phailin, and in 2018 by Cyclone Titli. In 2019, it was Cyclone Fani. ', 'While the first one killed more than 10,000 people, the death toll in the next three was below 100, thanks to the state’s improved disaster management skills. Besides these major disruptions, Odisha also had to deal with other climate-induced disasters such as heat waves, droughts, and floods. Such episodes are expected to increase in the future. The Fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2015) report predicts that India and other tropical countries will witness an increasing number of cyclones, storm surges and extreme rainfall in the future. ', 'While the Patnaik government did well to weather Cyclone Fani — the state mobilised resources and personnel to evacuate more than a million people — and save lives, the challenges ahead of the state now will be equally gargantuan. “While restoring infrastructure will be one aspect of the challenge, rebuilding lives of poor people, especially the vulnerable category, will be a much greater one. This will need some smart and long-term thinking on the part of the government,” said Amar Nayak, a disaster management expert, and ActionAid’s Global Humanitarian Adviser.  ', 'In February, members of the People’s Solidarity Forum, a state-level forum of people’s organisations from 14 districts of Odisha, released a manifesto that focused on exactly that: Long-term planning to improve disaster management and response, mitigation, and building resilience of coastal communities. These proposals can also be considered by India’s other coastal cities that don’t yet have a plan to tackle such events. ', 'One of the interesting suggestions in the manifesto is to develop a cadre of people who know how to swim, can fix electrical networks, drive speed boats, all of which are important skills in disaster situations, and then improve their skills further so that they can supplement the state’s efforts during such calamities. ', 'Second, there has to be a mapping of the most vulnerable population — single women, senior citizens, children, pregnant women, the physically challenged,Dalits — in villages and cities to ensure that they are rescued first. Third, regular disaster risk reduction trainings must be done.  Fourth, such disasters also mean loss of daily wages for poor people. It is critical to ensure that social protection programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme are implemented well so that people can resume their normal lives sooner rather than later. Fifth, each cyclone is also an ecological disaster, and all efforts must be made to regenerate nature’s own disaster managers, such as mangroves. ', '“Mangrove forests act as a buffer or shock absorber in time of such disasters. There is a clear indication that mangroves at Sundarbans saved Kolkata from Cyclone Aila in 2009, by absorbing a massive chunk of the cyclone’s fury,” Indian Forest Service officer, Parveen Kaswan, recently wrote in a blog. ', 'Unfortunately, the people who run India’s coastal cities are waging a war on these natural barriers. Take the example of Mumbai. A 2018 December report in Hindustan Times reported that mangrove destruction cases doubled in 2018, but there was not even one conviction. India’s financial capital should be careful becauseclimate change can increase cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea. ', 'Sixth, while a major portion of the focus after a disaster is on rural areas, there is a need to provide for the urban poor in cities. They need safe shelter, livelihood options with skill building and social security. Badly constructed buildings can be killers as much as cyclones and earthquakes. There is an urgent need to invest not just in cyclone shelters but also in cyclone-resilient construction, as per the Model Building Bye Laws, 2016, of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. ', 'Non-profits such as Save the Children have also raised the need to ensure psychological counselling for children to overcome such climate tragedies. ', 'Last, but not least, all Indian cities need city-level disaster management plans. Unfortunately, as most city governments struggle to deal with other day-to-day challenges such as education, infrastructure and health, climate resilience and adaptation figure low on their list of priorities. ', 'Cyclone Fani is a warning for cities: Learn to be climate resilient or the consequences will be severe.', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 07, 2019 19:37 IST\n']"
Learning governance lessons from China,2019-05-07, 20:34 IST,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/learning-governance-lessons-from-china/story-T83oNbIeKsOHp4Wakj2aeP.html,"['The halfway point of this long drawn-out election season is a good time to step back and evaluate the performance of the Indian State, and how it can be improved. The comparison with China is illustrative. In 1981, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in China and India were comparable. By 2017, China’s GDP per capita was more than double that of India — despite India experiencing its years of fastest growth in this period. Further, service delivery failures of the sort widely seen in India — including high absence rates of government teachers and doctors — are rare in China.', 'How has non-democratic China delivered so much more for its citizens than democratic India? There are several explanations, including a greater embrace of market-led principles in the structure of the economy, focusing on export-led manufacturing in labour-intensive sectors and achieving economies of scale in production, and delivering high quality basic education and health. However, in this piece, I want to focus less on “what” China does to be so successful, and more on the “why” and reflect on the implications for India. ', 'Specifically, the most important point that India would do well to learn from China is the centrality of incentives and accountability for political leaders and officials to deliver improved outcomes at all levels of the Chinese government. At the highest levels, there is a near obsessive focus on jobs, growth and development — way more so than in India. ', 'The reason is that governments obtain legitimacy through a combination of process and performance. Indian democracy provides governments considerable process-based legitimacy, based on winning elections. Thus, no one questions why a government is in power. However, in the absence of elections, the main source of legitimacy of the Chinese government comes from performance and delivering improving living standards. Thus, counter-intuitively, the non-democratic Chinese regime is more paranoid about improving the welfare of citizens than the democratically elected Indian government. In China, poor performance can lead to social unrest, and potentially even a revolution. In India, the worst thing that can happen to a non-performing government is getting voted out, and public employees are mostly unaffected.', 'The focus on performance at the highest levels of the Chinese government has, in turn, led to much greater investments in State capacity and building an effective machinery for governance and service delivery. In particular, there is great emphasis placed on measuring, monitoring, and rewarding performance of officials at all levels. Promotion prospects for lower-level party officials as well as public employees are linked to performance. Such a structure both improves incentives to perform at all levels of the government, and also leads to higher-performing officials and politicians getting promoted.', 'It is easy to attribute China’s success to having a “strong” State. This would be a mistake. Some of the greatest man-made disasters in the second half of the 20th century — including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution — happened when China was a “strong” State under Mao Zedong. Rather the under-appreciated lesson from China is that it started performing better when Deng Xiaoping’s reforms made it a more “accountable” State. ', 'Indian democracy provides “expressive utility” to voters by allowing political preferences to be expressed, and the courts and civil society provide some protection against government overreach. But, it has not delivered enough in making leaders and officials accountable for performance. There are at least two broad sets of reforms that will help in achieving this goal.', 'The first is meaningful decentralisation of budgets, and authority to local tiers of government — especially cities. This needs to be combined with direct elections of empowered mayors. Moving the locus of political accountability closer to the level where services are delivered will improve democratic incentives for service delivery, and also create a performance-based pipeline for senior leadership positions. It is worth recalling that Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra Prasad started their government careers as mayors of Allahabad, Ahmedabad, and Patna.', 'The second is a serious effort to improve the functioning of the Indian State with a focus on measurement of outcomes and to link the career progression of officials to objective measures of performance. Global research on management quality has identified personnel policy — hiring, training, postings, pay, and promotion — as the most important determinant of organisational effectiveness. High-performing organisations are characterised by autonomy to front-level officials on how to deliver, combined with accountability for outcomes. The Chinese State has deeply internalised this insight. The Indian State does the exact opposite — with micromanagement of processes, but limited accountability for outcomes. ', 'While we are rightly proud of our democracy, there is much to introspect and learn from how the Chinese State has created accountable administrative structures that have delivered meaningfully better outcomes for its citizens. Once the heat and dust of the elections settle down, we can hopefully start paying attention to improving the functioning of the Indian State.', 'Karthik Muralidharan is the Tata Chancellor’s professor of economics at UC San Diego ', 'The views expressed are personal ', '\nFirst Published:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMay 07, 2019 19:36 IST\n']"
